# Summary
This coherence run audits the repo artifacts for the orthodox qubit anchor: Lean sources plus UCC coverage outputs.

# Assumptions
Orthodox qubit anchor; no new physics claims. Audit is structural/traceability proxy.

# Limitations
Coherence audit does not execute Lean; it audits references and UCC outputs.

# Uncertainty
Rerun if Lean files or coverage module changes.

# Disclosure
Research scaffold only. Report issues via GitHub.

# Results
Quantum anchor coverage emits a report and audit bundle proving required theorem anchors are tracked.
