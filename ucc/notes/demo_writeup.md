# Summary
This note demonstrates the UCC coherence_audit pipeline on a small artifact.

# Assumptions
Toy audit: metrics are proxies; not a truth guarantee.

# Limitations
Minimal claims/sources. Not a peer-reviewed conclusion.

# Uncertainty
Depends on artifacts referenced and any perturbation variants provided.

# Disclosure
Research scaffold only. Report issues via GitHub.

# Result
We can represent an argument as claim-to-source mappings and audit traceability + drift.
